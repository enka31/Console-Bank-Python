## Important Notes

* **Data Persistence:** Customer data is stored in memory and will be lost when the program exits.
* **Security:** Passwords are stored as plain text, and admin credentials are hardcoded (`admin` / `123`). Not secure for production use.
* **Customer ID:** Unique numeric IDs are randomly generated for each customer.
* **Input Validation:** Basic validation is implemented for numeric inputs and options, but could be improved.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Add persistent storage (e.g., files or databases).
* Implement password hashing and better authentication.
* Improve input validation and error handling.
* Add a GUI for enhanced usability.
* Implement role-based access control.
